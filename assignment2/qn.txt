Numerical Methods

a) Solve a system of linear equations using Gauss-Jordan elimination, matrix inversion using Gauss-Jordan elimination, Iterative methods using Jacobiâ€™s method, and Gauss-Seidal method

b) Find the roots of a nonlinear equation using Newton-Raphson or bisection method.

c) Approximate an integral using numerical integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or Gaussian quadrature.

d) Solve an ordinary differential equation using numerical methods such as Euler's method, Runge-Kutta method.

e) consider your own data implement Langange interpolation, newton forward and backward difference formulae on interpolation.
